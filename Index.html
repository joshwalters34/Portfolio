            <p id= 'about-me'>
                My name is Josh Walters and I'm currently enrolled in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through UNC-Charlotte.  I am a graduate
                UNC-Charlotte with a Communications degree.  I've been working in the healthcare IT field for over 18 years.  I worked at the
                UNC-Charlotte Student Health Center for 9 years.  I was a Student Services Specialist and one of my duties was to test the 
                EMR system that we utilized.  I left the Student Health Center to pursue an opportunity with McKesson working on their EMR
                system, called Paragon.  I worked as a Quality Assurance Analyst, testing the software before it was sent out to customers.  
                During this time, I began to think about a career on the other side, actually doing the coding.  I feel that my experience
                testing the software will give me a unique understanding of how to code the software.
