# Josh Walters Portfolio
This portfolio page is a representation of my work and links to contact me.  At this point, I don't have any work to display, but as I proceed through the program, work will be added. In this website, I've tried to demonstrate some of the things I've learned thus far in class, including flex boxes, media queries,  variables, and hover effects.

## Motivation
My motivation for this website is to have a central location to display my work for potential employers. By the end of class, my goal is to have 5 websites that I can showcase on this portfolio page.
